# FountainSharp
An F# based Fountain Markdown processor that's based on the [FSharp.Formatting library](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting) by Tomas Petricek.

This project is a work in progress. To see where I'm at, check out the [syntax readme](Source/FountainSharp/FountainSharp.Parse/FountainSyntaxDefinition.md).

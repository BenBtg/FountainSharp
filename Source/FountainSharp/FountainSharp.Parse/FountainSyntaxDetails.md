# Line Breaks.

## Automatic Insertion

 * After a Scene Heading, a line break should probably always be inserted. This is a place where slugline falls down.

 * After Dialogue, it should also be inserted



## Parsing

 * during parsing, lines are split up by line breaks, so there isn't a way to detect them during spans (except for the forced two space thing)
